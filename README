Three python programmes:

	1. physics.py contains the algorithms and calculations. It cannot be run directly.

	2. vis.py uses physics.py to make an animation. Usage is vis.py N T M.
	   where N is the size of the grid, T is the temperature and M is the method
	   "G" for Glauber and "K" for Kawasaki. No data is saved from this animation.

	3. measurements.py was used to obtain and save data about the system as it evolved
	   at different temperatures. The temperature range and simulation length are hard-coded
	   in and must be changed in the file.
	   
	   
G4.png is the results from the Glauber run, the data is in results.G4.dat in the format
	(temperature, c, c error, energy, e error, magnetisation, m error, susceptibility, x error)

K2.png is Kawasaki results with the data in results.K2.dat in the same format.

Uses libraries: numpy, itertools, matplotlib.pyplot and tqdm
